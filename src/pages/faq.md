## FAQ

### Who made this?

Hi, I'm Chris. I collect European and American works on paper from the 15th through 21st centuries, with a particular emphasis on the history of etching. My interest in Samuel Colman was sparked by the chance purchase of a small cache of the artist's drawings in 2021. I started developmetn of this catalogue and website in the hazy days after the birth of my second child and have continued to develop it off and on since then.

To reach me, please email <a href="mailto:chrisgroskopf@gmail.com">chrisgroskopf@gmail.com</a>.

### Will you add my etching/photo to the catalogue?

Yes! If you believe you have an unrecorded Colman etching, please <a href="mailto:chrisgroskopf@gmail.com">email me</a> high-resolution photos of the front and back. Many of Colman's etchings were printed in extremely small numbers and never editioned. It's likely there are more out there I have not seen. Permission to use photos in the catalogue is always appreciated.

### Can you tell me how much my Colman artwork is worth?

I am neither qualified nor certified as an appraiser. In general Colman's etchings sell in the low hundreds of dollars. Colman's finest paintings have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. To have a specific work valued for sale or insurance, please seek out a professional appraiser.

### Will you buy my Colman artwork?

Maybe. I am an opportunistic collector and can not pay gallery prices, but if you just like the idea of selling to someone who really cares about Colman's work, <a href="mailto:chrisgroskopf@gmail.com">email me</a>.
