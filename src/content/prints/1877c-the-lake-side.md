This nondescript etching exists in only one public collection: the Rona and Martin Schneider Collection at Syracuse University. I’ve seen just two other copies for sale online. Syracuse University dates it to 1882, but it must be earlier since it is mentioned in Samuel Rosa Koehler’s article about Colman from 1880. The content of that article suggests it may have been created in 1877 when Colman “etched several more plates from nature.” All located copies are hand-signed, suggesting it was printed in a very limited number of impressions and never widely published.

A prepatory sketch for this drawing is in the Cooper Hewitt. It is inscribed “Below the Maple masses meet.”
