Though known through a single, untitled impression held at the Smithsonian Musuem of American Art, it’s very likely this etching of ducks in a farm yard is the third of three etchings of Long Island that Colman exhibited together in the 1881 exhibition of the British Society of Painter Etchers — most likely the one referred to as “Long Island Study”.

While there is no way to conclusively date this image, it seems likely all three of Colman’s etching of Long Island were made around a similar time.
