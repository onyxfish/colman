Little is known about this small etching, which was likely one of Colman’s first. It is listed in S.R. Koehler’s 1880 [article about Colman](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686), which describes it as “from nature”.  It also appears in [the catalogue](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686) of an 1881 exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Today the MFAB holds the only known impression, which was given to the museum as part of a gift from the artist in 1885. Sadly it has not been photographed.

Mt. Desert is an island northeast of Colman’s hometown of Portland, Maine. A plein air watercolor of Mt. Desert, also dated 1877, was sold [at Grogan and Company in 2019](https://www.groganco.com/auction-lot/samuel-colman-american-1832-1920-mt.-desert_1DE4D1C871) and may be from the same visit to the island.
