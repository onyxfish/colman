This etching is mentioned in an 1880 letter from Colman to Sylvester Rosa Koehler where he offers either "the plate of Stirling Castle" or ["the Durham subject"](#8) for publication in American Art Review. Stirling castle was also exhibited in 1879 at the Brooklyn Art Association and in 1880 with the American Watercolor Society.
