Colman probably drew this scene during his first trip to California in 1870 and etched it later in the decade. Of his early etchings, it is one of the most evocative and a significant example of his sinuous style of landscape drawing.

Colman seems to have been particularly proud of this etching. It was exhibited at [The British Society of Painter-Etchers](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_Journal/gxQYV1SDwvMC?gbpv=1&bsq=colman) (1881), the [Museum of Fine Arts Boston](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044033753179&view=1up&seq=9) (1881), and [The New York Etching Club](https://archive.org/details/31823000182376/page/n11/mode/1up) (1882).

An undated, preparatory sketch for the etching is in the [Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18369101/).
