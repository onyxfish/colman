Colman likely drew this scene during his first trip to California in 1870 and etched it later in the decade. Of his early etchings, it is one of the most evocative and a significant, early example of his sinuous style of drawing landscapes.

Despite it’s scarcity today, Colman seems to have been proud to show this etching. It is listed in S.R. Koehler’s 1880 [article about Colman](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686) and was exhibited at [The British Society of Painter-Etchers](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_Journal/gxQYV1SDwvMC?gbpv=1&bsq=colman) (1881), [The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044033753179&view=1up&seq=9) (1881), and [The New York Etching Club](https://archive.org/details/31823000182376/page/n11/mode/1up) (1882).

Today the only known impression of this image is in [The National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.148735.html). A undated, preparatory sketch for it is in [The Cooper Hewitt](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18369101/).
