This picturesque view of [Durham Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Castle) was Colman's response to commmission from Sylvester Rosa Koehler to create an etching for _American Art Review_. Koehler was a major booster of Colman's work and rhapsodized his etchings in the accompanying article as "among the most interesting of the works so far produced by the etchers of America." This etching was subsequently republished in two other volumes, making it by far Colman's most widely circulated image.
