It’s very likely this etching of ducks in a farm yard is the third of three etchings of Long Island that Colman exhibited together in [the 1881 exhibition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_Journal/gxQYV1SDwvMC?gbpv=1&bsq=colman) of the British Society of Painter Etchers — most likely the one referred to as “Long Island Study”.

While there is no way to conclusively date this image, it seems likely all three etchings of Long Island were made around a similar time.
