This is the only one of Colman's etchings known to survive in many states. The Museum of Fine Arts Boston holds a series of eight working proofs donated by art historian Sylvester Rosa Koehler. Koehler was the editor of the _Original Etchings by American Artists_, where this etching was first published, and also authored [a brief, but important article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686) about Colman in The American Art Review. [Another signed proof](https://onlinecollections.syr.edu/objects/41626/a-cloudy-day-in-venice) is at the Syracuse University Art Museum.
