Of all Colman’s etchings, this one probably has the most complete surviving history. This is thanks to a series of eight working proofs given to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston by art historian Sylvester Rosa Koehler. Koehler was the editor of the Original Etchings by American Artists, where this etching was first published, and also authored [a brief, but important article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686) about Colman in The American Art Review. Sadly none of the museum’s proofs have been digitized, though [another signed proof](https://onlinecollections.syr.edu/objects/41626/a-cloudy-day-in-venice) in the Rona and Martin Schneider Collection at Syracuse University has.
