This is the second of three etchings created by Colman for the “Zuyder Zee Edition” of Holland and Its People by Edmondo de Amicis. ([Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Holland_and_Its_People/OXE-AAAAYAAJ)) It appears opposite page 246.

The [1891 exhibition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Publication_by_the_New_York_Etching_Cl/6glLAQAAMAAJ) of The New York Exhibition Club included an etching titled Old Tower at Amsterdam. This is presumed to be the same print catalogued here.

It’s also likely, though not certain that this is Amsterdam, Holland which was shown in the [1880 exhibition](https://www.academia.edu/37356531/Annual_Exhibition_Record_of_the_American_Watercolor_Society_1867_1921_version_2) of the American Watercolor Society.
