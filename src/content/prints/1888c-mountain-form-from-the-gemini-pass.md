This etching is listed in the catalogue of a 1981 sale of Colman's work at the Barridoff Galleries. (_Samuel Colman: East and West from Portland_) There it is identified as "Etching, First State (2 only taken)." It is unclear if this print was ever finished or if the two proofs mentioned here represent all that were ever printed. Most of the works in this sale came directly from the artist's estate.

The subject of this etching is probably [Mount Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(California_mountain)), in Fresno County, CA. Though the Barridoff catalogue does not date the work, it is likely circa 1888, when Colman traveled to California and produced many drawings of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
