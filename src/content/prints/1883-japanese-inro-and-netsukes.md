TK Colman the collector. Japonisme

Colman’s etchings of Japanese carvings are among the hardest to definitively pin down. An etching titled Japanese Inro and Netsukes first appears in [the 1884 exhibition](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044033753179) of The New York Etching Club. Much later, [the 1891 exhibition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Publication_by_the_New_York_Etching_Cl/6glLAQAAMAAJ) of The New York Etching Club included Japanese Turo and Netsukies. Two years later [the World’s Columbian Exhibition in 1893](https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/worldscolumbian10worl) included two prints, titled Japanese Inro with Netzukies and Japanese Inro with Netzukies (No. 2). Only one etching of and into with netsukes has been definitively located, which is catalogued here, however, [an 1894 article](http://japanese%20inro%20with%20netzukies/) by Colman’s friend James D. Smillie features a partial image of another Colman etching title Japanese Inro and Netsuke, which is almost certainly the same as No. 2 from the World’s Columbian Exhibition.

Further confusing things, The Museum of Fine Arts at Boston has unphotographed etchings catalogued under the titles [Japanese Inro and Netsukes](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101126/japanese-inro-and-netsukes), [Japanese Netsukes](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101133/japanese-netsukes), and [Japanese Inro](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101136/japanese-inro) but all dated 1880. Presumably these are the same three prints catalogued here, but it’s difficult to be certain.
