This etching is illustrated in [_American Etchings of the Nineteenth Century: 115 Prints_](https://archive.org/details/americanetchings0000unse/)) and credited to the collection of Patricia Carroll Fitzgerald Mandel. No other copies are known. Many of Ms. Mandel's prints are now in the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, however, this print is either not amongst them or has not been catalogued.

Though Colman would live another 20 years, this is presumed to be the last etching he created. His artistic output declined dramatically in the final two decades of his life. Instead, he wrote two, largely-forgotten books on art theory, married for a second time, and fathered his first child at the age of 76.
