Colman was an avid collector of Asian decorative objects, including prints, pottery, and Japanese _netsuke_ (carved button fasteners) and _inro_ (small boxes to be hung from a sash). In 1880 Colman wrote to Sylvestor Rosa Koehler that he was making "a series of etchings now from some of my art objects."

Unfortunantely, exactly how many etchings he made is a extremely difficult to discern. Colman was never consistent with naming his etchings and limited detail in the exhibition history makes it difficult to know which names refer to the same prints:

- In [1881](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044033753179): "Japanese Incense Burner" and "The Sacred Bean, Japanese Inro"
- In [1884](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044033753179): "Japanese Inro and Netsukes"
- In [1893](https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/worldscolumbian10worl): "Japanese Inro with Netzukies" and "Japanese Inro with Netzukies (No. 2)"
- In [an 1894 article](https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015017525703?urlappend=%3Bseq=274%3Bownerid=13510798897445288-304): "Japanese Inro and Netsuke"

Further confusing things, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston has unphotographed etchings catalogued under the titles ["Japanese Inro and Netsukes"](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101126/japanese-inro-and-netsukes), ["Japanese Netsukes"](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101133/japanese-netsukes), and ["Japanese Inro"](https://collections.mfa.org/objects/101136/japanese-inro), all dated 1880. Presumably these are the same three prints catalogued here, but itâ€™s difficult to be certain.
