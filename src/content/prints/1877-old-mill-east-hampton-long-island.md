This etching is mentioned in S.R. Koehlerâ€™s 1880 [article about Colman](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20559686), as well as in two articles referencing exhibitions in [New York](https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn83030313/1879-12-08/ed-1/?sp=6&q=%22samuel+colman%22&r=0.392,0.724,0.316,0.2,0) (1879) and [London](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_Journal/gxQYV1SDwvMC?gbpv=1) (1881) and. There are only two copies known in museum collections and neither have been photographed.

Colman would return to the subject of a mill on Long Island again with [East Hampton, Long Island](#31) and [Old Mill at Wainscott, Long Island](#19).
