This rare etching is the subject of a letter Colman wrote to “Mrs. Moran” that is archived at the University of Birmingham. (TK presumably the wife of Thomas Moran, a close friend) The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, which holds the only two known impressions of this etching, dates it to 1883. Whether it was etched at that time, or later in 1885 when the letter was written, it’s likely it was based on a drawing from one of Colman’s earlier trips to Europe.
