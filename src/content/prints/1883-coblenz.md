This etching is the subject of [an 1885 letter](https://calmview.bham.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=XKWH%2FQ%2F1127) Colman wrote to “Mrs. Moran.” (Presumably Mary Nimmo Moran, a fellow etcher and wife of Thomas Moran, who was a close friend and traveling companion.)  The Museum of Fine Arts Boston, which holds the only two known impressions of this etching, dates it to 1883. Whether it was etched at that time, or later in 1885 when the letter was written, it’s more than likely based on a drawing from one of Colman’s earlier trips to Europe.
