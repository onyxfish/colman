This etching is the subject of [an 1885 letter](https://calmview.bham.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=XKWH%2FQ%2F1127) Colman wrote to “Mrs. Moran.” (Presumably Mary Nimmo Moran, a fellow etcher and wife of Thomas Moran, who was a close friend and traveling companion.)  It is likely based on a drawing from Colman’s tour of Europe in the 1870's.

The etching was later published, at least once, in Germany by Wien Verlag der Gesellschaft für vervielfältigende Kunst. (The Society for Reproducing Art) The exact volume in which it was published remains unknown.
