For reasons that are not immediately obvious, this etching has a different name in every museum collection where it is found. It should also not be confused with the similarly named [Old Mill, East Hampton, Long Island](#2) and [East Hampton, L.I.](#31).

The folio from which this etching originates is exceedingly rare. Only [one copy](https://bepl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1077322/one) could be located in any American institution and it appears to be incomplete. The date of publication is also unclear, but it must have been prior to 1885 when Colman gave a copy of this etching to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.
