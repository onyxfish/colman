It’s likely this is the etching described only as “Etched from Nature” in [the 1881 exhibition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Art_Journal/gxQYV1SDwvMC?gbpv=1&bsq=colman) of the British Society of Painter Etchers. It was also exhibited at [the 1891 exhibition](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Publication_by_the_New_York_Etching_Cl/6glLAQAAMAAJ) of the New York Etching Club where it was similarly described as “etched from nature”. The Museum of Fine Arts Boston holds the only known copy, which they refer to as “Barn Yard at East Hampton, Long Island”. 

While there is no way to conclusively date this image, it seems verwy likely to have been made at the same time as [Old Mill, East Hampton, Long Island](#2) and [Untitled [Farmyard with Ducks]](#5), which appears to depict the same location.
