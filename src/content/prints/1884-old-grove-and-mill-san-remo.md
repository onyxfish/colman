The only known impression of this etching is part of the Rona and Martin Schneider Collection at Syracuse University. Colman refers to it as _Olive Grove & Mill, San Remo_ in [1891](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Publication_by_the_New_York_Etching_Cl/6glLAQAAMAAJ) and _Olive Grove & Mill, Bordighera, Italy_ in [1893](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044033807371&view=1up&seq=130&q1=colman). The Syracuse University Art Museum refers to it as _Old Mill in the Riviera Valley_, though the origin of this name is unknown.
