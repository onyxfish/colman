The only known impression of this etching is part of the Rona and Martin Schneider Collection at Syracuse University. Colman refers to it as Olive Grove & Mill, San Remo in 1891 and Olive Grove & Mill, Bordighera, Italy in 1893. The Syracuse University Art Museum refers to it as Old Mill in the Riviera Valley, though the origin of this name is unknown.
